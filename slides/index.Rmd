# Key Terms & Information

- Center of Gravity (CoG)


- obs: (character), observation number
- s_cog: (numeric), center of gravity measurement in Hz for [s].
- s_skewness: (numeric), skewness measurement for [s].
- sh_cog: (numeric), center of gravity measurement in Hz for [ʃ].
- sh_skewness: (numeric), skewness measurement for [ʃ].

# Findings
The current study investigated English voiceless fricatives using acoustic tools. The researchers examined two spectral parameters: center of gravity(CoG) and skewness. A total of 20 trials were investigated for the voiceless fricatives /s/ and /sh/.  The results in Figure 2 indicate a positive correlation for the phoneme /s/ for both skewness and CoG values. However, observation of the data reveals two unusual points.

# Credits
It was a pleasure to collaborate with Kaylee and Patrick on this coding adventure. Kyle was also a great support and offered some great insights.

Thank you!!
